# Bengt Söderlund

I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics transitioning into a data science career. My background is in international trade and applied econometrics, with extensive experience in empirical modeling, causal inference, and working with large-scale structured datasets.

Over the past two years I’ve built a portfolio of Python, SQL, and R projects that apply machine learning, causal inference, and financial data analysis to real-world problems. My work now includes production-ready, end-to-end pipelines using modern MLOps tools.

## Selected Projects

- **Shipment Prediction Pipeline**  
  End-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting late shipments using public retailer order data.  
  *Tools:* Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Docker, AWS (ECS, ECR, S3, IAM, CloudWatch), MLflow, Prefect, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)  
  *Metrics:* 92.1% accuracy and 97.3% recall across two optimized Random Forest models

- **Financial Data Pipeline and KPI Analysis**  
  Automated ingestion and storage of company financials from the Alpha Vantage API with SQL querying and Python visualization.  
  *Tools:* Python, SQL (SQLite), requests, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

- **Causal Impact of the EU–Ukraine FTA**  
  Empirical evaluation of trade agreement effects using a dynamic gravity model.  
  *Tools:* R (tidyverse, ggplot2), econometric modeling, causal inference
