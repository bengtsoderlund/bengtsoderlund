# Bengt Söderlund

I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics transitioning into a data science career. My background is in international trade and applied econometrics, with extensive experience in empirical modeling, causal inference, and working with large-scale structured datasets.

I’ve recently built several Python, SQL, and R projects that apply machine learning, causal inference, and financial data analysis to real-world problems. You’ll find a selection of these projects below:

- Financial data pipeline and KPI analysis using API and SQL  
- Predictive modeling of late shipments using Python and machine learning  
- Causal impact evaluation of the EU–Ukraine FTA using a dynamic gravity model in R

## Technical Skills

**Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL, R, Git, Jupyter, Stata  
**Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, requests, sqlite3  
**Core Areas:** Machine Learning, Causal Inference, Data Wrangling, Big Data Analysis, Econometric Modeling

## More About Me

I'm currently based in Sweden and will be relocating to the U.S. in 2026. I will have full work authorization through a spousal green card and won’t require employer sponsorship.
