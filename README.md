I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics transitioning into a data science career. My background is in international trade and applied econometrics, with extensive experience in empirical modeling, causal inference, and working with large-scale structured datasets.



Over the past two years I’ve built a portfolio of Python, SQL, and R projects that apply machine learning, causal inference, and financial data analysis to real-world problems. My work now includes production-ready, end-to-end pipelines using modern MLOps tools.



\## Selected Projects



\- \*\*Shipment Prediction Pipeline\*\*  

&nbsp; End-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting late shipments using public retailer order data.  

&nbsp; Tools: Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Docker, AWS (ECS, ECR, S3, IAM, CloudWatch), MLflow, Prefect, CI/CD (GitHub Actions).  

&nbsp; Metrics: 92.1% accuracy and 97.3% recall across two optimized Random Forest models.



\- \*\*Financial Data Pipeline and KPI Analysis\*\*  

&nbsp; Automated ingestion and storage of company financials from Alpha Vantage API, with SQL-based querying and Python visualization.  

&nbsp; Tools: Python, SQL (SQLite), requests, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn.



\- \*\*Causal Impact of the EU–Ukraine FTA\*\*  

&nbsp; Empirical evaluation of trade agreement effects using a dynamic gravity model.  

&nbsp; Tools: R (tidyverse, ggplot2), econometric modeling, causal inference.
